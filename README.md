This is a free-to-use Bash script that allows you to easily install cPanel, optimize it, and enhance its security with a single command. You can utilize this script on a blank server or an existing cPanel server, making it suitable for both new and experienced cPanel users.

The script handles the entire cPanel installation process, including activating the cPanel license and configuring it to run all CMS websites. It ensures the security of your cPanel server by changing the SSH port, installing a firewall, and automatically updating the firewall rules to reflect the new SSH port.

It configures all the necessary tweak settings, as well as installs and secures memcache and ImageMagick.
